distinguish between less than 4 values apart so this is something to keep in mind the following algorithm does not compensate for this im not sure this is exactly what you want but this is one way to randomly generate nonrepeating color values beware inconsistent pseudocode ahead  one way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array  but this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example          0.047619\n","1           1      3  180       1      7            0.161577           0.117777        52       275         5.288462     0      0     2.216136

come up with a way to generate  colors that are as distinguishable as possible where  is a parameter  my first thought on this is how generate n vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other you can see that the rgb or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space are just vectors take a look at random point picking hope this is a good start for you once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part you can save them in a hash table or something for later and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other edit thinking about this problem more it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor possibly 000  255255255 lexicographically and then distribute them evenly i really dont know how well this will work but it should since lets say n  10 we know we have 16777216 colors 2563 we can use buckles algorithm 515 to find the lexicographically indexed color youll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements          1.000000\n","3           3     17  180       3      5            0.060784           0.086928        55       370

somewhere the human eye cant distinguish between less than 4 values apart so this is something to keep in mind the following algorithm does not compensate for this im not sure this is exactly what you want but this is one way to randomly generate nonrepeating color values beware inconsistent pseudocode ahead  one way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array  but this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example          0.047619   False           0\n","1           1      3  180       1      7            0.161577           0.117777        52       275

never quite found a solution thats stuck with me the problem is to come up with a way to generate  colors that are as distinguishable as possible where  is a parameter  my first thought on this is how generate n vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other you can see that the rgb or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space are just vectors take a look at random point picking hope this is a good start for you once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part you can save them in a hash table or something for later and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other edit thinking about this problem more it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor possibly 000  255255255

                                it would be best to find colors maximally distant in a perceptually uniform colorspace eg cielab using euclidean distance between l a b coordinates as your distance metric and then converting to the colorspace of your choice  perceptual uniformity is achieved by tweaking the colorspace to approximate the nonlinearities in the human visual system          0.809524
