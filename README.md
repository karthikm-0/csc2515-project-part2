# csc2515-project-part2
This file describes all the submission files as part of our project. 

Python Notebooks:
1.	csc2515-project-stackoverflow.ipynb: Pre-process the original Stack Overflow 10% dataset and extract numerical features.It outputs train.csv as the machine learning training set to feed into the Models_Training.ipynb.
2.	Models_Training.ipynb: training the different classical and modern machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, multi layer perceptron (MLP), CNN, LSTM.
3.	1D-CNN-LSTM.ipynb: Similar to Models_Training.ipynb, it trains the CNN-LSTM model.

Data:
1.	Train.csv: contains the pre-processed dataset which we then use to train our machine learning models. The file can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MS_GfLCWG21EfmcbvZWsH-k5jAbh7Rq-/view?usp=sharing
